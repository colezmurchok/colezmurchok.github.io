Suppose you want to randomly choose a direction. Maybe you're a neutrophil, a type of immune cell, and you're searching for a bacteria. Which direction should you choose? Maybe you're coding, or building a mathematical model and you want to choose a random direction to move in.

**How do you <em>uniformly</em> choose a direction in 2-dimensions?**

I think that the easiest thing to do is to uniformly pick an angle, $$ \theta \in [0, 2 \pi),$$ and then convert to a vector on the unit circle:

$$
\begin{align*} x&=\cos \theta \\ y&=\sin \theta \end{align*}
$$

This method works! If you sample 100 points from a uniform distribution on $$ \theta \in [0,2\pi)$$, and plot the result, it looks pretty uniform on the unit circle:

</p>

The reason this works is that we want any little segment of arc length on the unit circle to have the same number of points. In terms of differentials (arc-length-elements and theta-elements), we have

$$ ds = \sqrt{dx^2 + dy^2} = \sqrt{d\theta^2} = d\theta $$

because $$x = \cos \theta$$ and $$y = \sin \theta$$.

**Does the same method work in 3-dimensions?**

Interestingly, no! If you were to randomly choose two angles $$\theta \in [0, 2\pi)$$ and $$\phi \in [0, \pi]$$, and use spherical coordinates

$$ x = \cos \theta \sin \phi, \quad y = \sin \theta \sin \phi, \quad z = \cos \phi,$$

then you would observe cluster of points at the poles. You can see this in the figure on the left, or by looking at a top down view, as on the right:

</p>

This method fails in 3D due to the fact that not all latitudes have the same circumference! In other words, our method breaks because the area element

$$ d \Omega = \sin \phi d \theta d \phi$$

is a function of $$\phi$$. Note that you could choose a transformation other than spherical coordinates so that this works nicely if you wanted to (<a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/SpherePointPicking.html" rel="noopener">http://mathworld.wolfram.com/SpherePointPicking.html</a>).

**$$n$$-dimensional uniform distributions on the unit sphere.**

It turns out that one of the easiest ways generate a uniform distribution on the $$n$$-dimension unit sphere is to actually use $$ n$$ normal distributions...

The density function for a normally distributed random variable vector $$X$$ is

$$ p(x; \mu,\Sigma) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{ (2 \pi)^n \det(\Sigma)}} \exp \left( -\frac{1}{2} (x-\mu)^T \Sigma^{-1} (x-\mu) \right).$$

For the sake of example, consider the case where the covariance is identity, $$ \Sigma = I$$, and the mean is $$ \mu = \vec{0}$$. Then

$$ \begin{align*} p(x;0,I) &= \frac{1}{\sqrt{ (2 \pi)^n}} \exp \left( -\frac{1}{2} \sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2 \right) \\
&= \frac{1}{\sqrt{ 2 \pi}} \exp \left( -\frac{x_1^2}{2} \right) \cdot \ldots \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{ 2 \pi}} \exp \left( -\frac{x_n^2}{2} \right).
\end{align*}
$$

In general, we can conclude thatÂ a $$ n$$-dimensional Gaussian with mean $$ \mu \in \mathbb{R}^n$$ and diagonal covariance matrix $$ \Sigma = \text{diag}(\sigma_1^2, \dots, \sigma_n^2)$$ is the same as a collection of $$ n$$ independent Gaussian random variables with mean $$ \mu_i$$ and variance $$ \sigma_i^2$$.

From this, we can sample uniformly random points on the $$ n$$-dimension unit sphere by generatating $$n$$ standard normal random variables $$x_i$$ and normalizing:

$$\frac{1}{\sqrt{x_1^2 + \cdots + x_n^2}} (x_1,\dots,x_n)^T.$$

On the unit sphere in $$n$$-dimensions, $$ \sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2 = 1$$,

$$ p(x;0,I) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{ (2 \pi)^n}} \exp \left( -\frac{1}{2} \sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2 \right) = \frac{e^{-\frac{1}{2}}}{\sqrt{ (2 \pi)^n}} $$

is spherically symmetric, i.e., the distribution is constant!

This works! No clustering!
