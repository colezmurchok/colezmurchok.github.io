### About Me

I am an NSERC Postdoctoral Research Fellow in the Department of Physics and Astronomy at [Vanderbilt University].

I use mathematical modeling, analysis, and computation to understand how the interactions and feedback loops between a biological system's parts give rise to biological function and organization. I work in collaboration with [William Holmes].

I was the Senior Co-Chair of the [Vanderbilt Postdoctoral Association] for 2019-2020.

Before that, I completed a PhD in Mathematics at [The University of British Columbia], advised by [Leah Edelstein-Keshet].

I enjoy teaching mathematics and working with others on developing instructional skills. When I am not thinking about math or teaching, I can be found out cycling, skiing, or drinking coffee.
