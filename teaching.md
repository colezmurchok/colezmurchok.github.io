### Teaching

I enjoy teaching mathematics and working with others on developing instructional skills. I received a [Killam Graduate Teaching Assistant Award] in the 2016/2017 academic year, and have  worked as a [facilitator] of [Instructional Skills Workshops] and as [peer reviewer of teaching] at the Centre for Teaching, Learning and Technology at UBC. I co-organized a community of practice, <a href="GSISG/GSISG.html">Graduate Student Instructor Support Group</a>, with <a href="http://www.math.ubc.ca/~colesmp">Matt Coles</a>.

I volunteered with the [Future Science Leaders] program at Science World in Vancouver, BC, and I worked as a Tutor for [Indigenous Students in Science Courses] at the [UBC First Nations Longhouse]. As an undergraduate student, I developed a series of [web-based instructional modules] for the teaching and learning of modern applications of mathematics with [Gerda de Vries].
